nddtune: Solaris SMF ndd tuning for settings not settable in /etc/system

LICENSE
  See LICENSE for licensing details

REQUIREMENTS:
  Solaris (10+)

INSTALLATION
  Copy the nddtune method to the method directory (/lib/svc/method)
  Make the nddtune method executable
  Copy the nddtune manifest to the manifest directory (/lib/svc/manifest/system)
  Import the manifest: svccfg import /lib/svc/manifest/system/nddtune.xml

  Note: Alternatively, you can copy them to a different location, in which case you
        must update the manifest to reflect the true location of the method repository
        for the 'start' exec_method.

USAGE:
  Standard SMF commands (enable, disable, refresh).
  Note: nddtune currently does NOT implement the disable action (ie, it cannot
        restore previous values).

CONFIGURARTION
  The default configuration file is /local/etc/nddtune.cfg but its location can be
  changed by updating the nddtune/cfgfile property, either by updating the manifest
  before importing it or by using svccfg setprop:

   svccfg -s svc:/system/nddtune setprop nddtune/cfgfile=/location/for/nddtune.cfg

  The configuration itself is simply the parameters to a ndd -set call. For example:

   /dev/tcp tcp_xmit_hiwat 2883584
   /dev/tcp tcp_recv_hiwat 2883584
   /dev/tcp tcp_max_buf 2883584

  Lines can be commented out with a # sign at the beggining of the line.

ERROR HANDLING
  Check svcs nddtune for service state. nddtune is fairly conservative: if anything
  causes an error (missing configuration file, error runnig ndd -set), nddtune stops
  and sets the service to maitenance status. See svc logfile for details.
